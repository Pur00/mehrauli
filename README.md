# Read Me
There are some things that you need to know before you can start making any changes to the source code.

## Usage Rights
As mentioned in the license (which may be a little too long to read so I will summarise it for you), you are not allowed to use this game for any commercial purpose, particularly for selling. If you publish it anywhere, you must give the author (Puroo Roy) credit. You may modify the source code is acceptable, but that does not make this your own work. Your game will also be considered open-source, giving others the legal right to further edit your work.

All the models, audio logs, code snippets, story and most importantly, the concept have been all created by me. The background music used for the game does not have a copyright. It is called *【No Copyright】1 Hour Sad and Emotional Piano Music Collection with quotes*, and is a work of the YouTube channel My Music Playlist ([published 10 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20240110160830/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75DdDuSZ4rg&t=1s)). Consequently, none of the assets used in making the game have any form of copyright on them in any manner, thus making everyone free to use the source file of the game.
## Setup
### Plugins
After downloading all the files, you must download the [Heightmap Terrain](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin) plugin by [Marc Zylann](https://github.com/Zylann). Follow the instructions on the README of the repository to successfully make your terrain modifier work. Keep in mind that this terrain will only work on Godot 3 and 3.5, but not on Godot 4. The game was developed using Godot 3.5, back when Godot 4 had just released so the terrain was not compatible with the latter.
### Programming Language
The language used for the scripts is GDScript. Therefore, you may have to switch to it in case you are using C# or C++. There are more documentations available on GDScript so if you have never used it before, you may find several tutorials online, including those by Godot themselves.
### Input Support
The game currently only supports keyboard usage. This is just to let you know beforehand, in case you do not use a keyboard to play on a computer due to any issues. Adding a controller and touch support will be greatly appreciated. If you do so, please commit the change to this repository while adding your name in the credits.
## Development
### Folders
The files in the `res://` folder have not been put in any more folders, because the game makes the assets not show their materials. While it is suggested that you do not create folders if you are not an expert in Godot, helping reduce the clutter is also appreciated. If you do so, you may credit yourself as a manager. Commit the change to the repository, as it will help future developers on the project.

**Do not, under any circumstance, delete any of the source files, even when you are not using them. This will cause the game to stop running.** I learnt this the hard way.

Thank you for reading through this. You now know everything you are supposed to for downloading and editing the document. If you wish to connect with me, leave a message on any of the social media handles mentioned on [my profile](https://github.com/Pur00).
